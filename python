""" A shopkeeper is recording the daily sales of an item for N days, where the price of the item remains the same for all days. Write a program to calculate the total sales for each day and save them in a file named sales.txt that can store the data for a maximum of 30 days. Then, read the file and display the total earnings for each day.



Note: Total Earnings for each day = Number of Items sold in that day Ã— Price of the item.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of days.

The second line of input consists of N space-separated integers representing the number of items sold each day.

The third line of input consists of an integer M, representing the price of the item that is common for all N days.

Output format :
If the number of days entered exceeds 30 (N > 30), the output prints "Exceeding limit!" and terminates.

Otherwise, the code reads the contents of the file and displays the total earnings for each day on separate lines."""

N = int(input())
items_input = input().split()
price = int(input())

if N > 30:
    print("Exceeding limit!")
else:
    items = [int(item) for item in items_input]
    
    with open("sales.txt", "w") as of:
        for item in items:
            of.write(str(item * price) + '\n')

    with open("sales.txt", "r") as inputFile:
        for line in inputFile:
            print(int(line))
